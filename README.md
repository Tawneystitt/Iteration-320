System Request: The Kids Center for Pediatric Therapies. 

 

The Kids Center for Pediatric Therapies needs a patient portal that would allow staff to keep track of patient records, and scheduling for episodes of care.  This website should include a business process that allows users to access a patient portal for scheduling. The purpose would be to allow users to make appointments, cancel an appointment, and an option for patients on a waitlist to fill in a cancellation. The tabs identified as needed are About Us, Contacts, Ways to Give/donations, services, calendar, and make payment. The dashboard business process we recommend is to make an appointment, this will direct you to a patient portal where users can create an account with The Kid’s Center for Pediatric Therapy and access their information, make an appointment, or cancel an appt. This system can give patients 24/7 access to self-schedule or request an appointment.  We recommend the inclusion of an SSO option to allow the reduction of theft because users only log in once a day and only use one set of credentials.

Narrative 

With the Kid’s Center being established in 1958 and still running till today, their website has not gained much improvement. The Kid’s Center website has been the powerhouse for their business by helping kids with disabilities. Make a payment portal on their website focuses on making payment online but there is nowhere to schedule appointments online. Clients must call their number to schedule appointments and that can be difficult for the staff at the front desk to keep up with all those calls. 

The kids center software doesn’t have enough detail to allow clients to schedule appointments or access their record. With those details missing, it can be very difficult for clients to navigate thought their website. The head manager at the kids' center is in search of ways they can resolve this current issue of gathering and placing new features to make the front desk life a little easier. 

We have identified that the kids center website is very confusing to navigate. By building a secure portal to make their website more efficient, the goal of the proposed business process is to decrease the waitlist on their floater list. This will be done by building a patient and appointment portal that lets users access their medical records and makes it easier to schedule appointments online. 

 

Technical Feasibility 

To build this business process, we plan on using a CMS called WordPress.org, a free open-source software which requires no technical skills or coding knowledge. Webhosting and domain name is needed to access the security and backups of the database. The webhosting platform we have chosen is Authorize.net, a platform known for payments and its security features. The functionality of the CMS will be maintained through regular update by the staff. Finally, upon request from the project sponsor or client, PayPal checkout, a PMS platform will be added to fulfill the capabilities for client to make payments after their appointment.  

 

Economic Feasibility 

Since the Kid’s center already have a predesign software that is already integrated with a cost on their website, the additional cost that will come in account will be from the webhosting and domain form the CMS as well as the PMS. To host the database, Authorize.net will charge a monthly fee of $25 with a $0.10 per transaction and $0.10 daily batch fees to keep it up and running. WordPress.org is open source and free of charge to use. If a PMS system is requested, PayPal charge $3.49% fee paired with a $0.49 fixed fee.  

Organization Feasibility 

Since the kid’s center staff have no identified coding knowledge to build the feature requested, we need to design new features with minimal maintenance, so the database remains functional in the long term. Although they already have a predesign system, with WordPress.org and Authorize.net being user friendly, once put in place, the staff will be able to keep up with it with little to no trouble. Information gathered by the staff from patients will be streamlined through the new feature we have inserted on the database.  Generally, the new features will be easy and user friendly since our clients are not coding experts. 

 

 

 

 

Process Models: 

 

The process model, as is currently, lacks the appointment portal that would allow the patient to schedule a rendezvous. My team and I have decided to create an appointment scheduling tool also known as an appointment portal to facilitate users to make an appointment. The way the website is constructed as of now, there is a make payment portal which the user can click on, and it takes you to a tool called Tebra patient portal, this allows a patient sign-in where the user will be able to insert the Email and Password.  To schedule an appointment, a patient must get in touch with the front desk of the kids center for pediatric therapy via general inquiries, make a phone call, or Email. The front desk will handle the scheduling or cancellation, and once the appointment is confirmed, the date and time should be provided to the patient. Fusion is the primary system The Kid’s Center for Pediatric Therapy utilizes as an appointment scheduling tool. Zingit is also a tool used to send automatic appointment reminders via text. Based on their needs and concerns, we believe their scheduling tool is not as efficient as needed, and a business process called “Make an appointment” should be integrated into their website which takes you to a new scheduling portal that allows staff to keep track of appointments/cancellation or episodes of care appointments (where 2-3 children share the appointment time) we would also like this tool to contain a way to incorporate a waitlist option where individuals will automatically receive a message when there is an appointment available. This option we believe would benefit Kid’s Center for Pediatric Therapies non-profit organization.

The improvement we have made and proposed to kids center for pediatric therapy as shown above is that we have created an appointment portal separate from make payment whereby the patient will click on schedule appointment after opening the website, create an account (Email and Password) if they don’t have one, and sign in to schedule an appointment. If the password or Email is incorrect, they will be able to try again, and if the issue persists, they can simply reset password. If there is no issue with the credentials, the appointment scheduling portal will open allowing them to make one at their convenient date and time, and we have also provided cancel appointment if they want to do so. Once the appointment has been scheduled, the visit is confirmed.
